# Auto Reading Mode

Annoyed of files still being in editing mode after leaving or closing Obsidian? Auto Reading Mode is for you!

This plugin automatically switches Markdown pages in Live Preview or Source mode into Reading view after some period of time.

The timer runs while Obsidian is active or minimized.

# Usage

Go into the plugin settings to configure:

-   **Timeout (minutes)** - Timeout before reading mode is enabled while Obsidian is active or minimized.
-   **Startup in Reading mode** - Show previously opened documents in Reading view when starting Obsidian.
