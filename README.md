# Auto Reading View

Annoyed of files still being in editing mode after leaving or closing Obsidian? Auto Reading View is for you!

This plugin automatically switches Markdown pages in Live Preview or Source mode into Reading mode after some period of time.

The timer runs while Obsidian is active or minimized.
